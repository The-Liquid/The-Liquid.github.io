My name is Aaron Taylor,

I am a video production artist, lighting nerd, and on camera personality. I have a rich passion for showing the elegance of anything in front of my camera, which as allowed me to work with Ocean Vodka and The Zero Proof on cinematic shorts, cocktail designs, and informative content about their products.

I welcome the opportunity to talk with you about your ideas.
